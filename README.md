* __First time user Goals__
    * I want to easily know what the website is about, and why I should pay any interest to it. 
    * I want to be able to navigate through the website un-obstructed. 
    *
* __Returning user Goals__  
    * I want to have a section which will navigate to an external link in order to book accommodation.
    * I want a section which will allow me to RSVP. 
    * I want a section which allows me to choose menu items for the day of the wedding.
