# The Wedding of Chris & Sally
## UX Design
### Strategy
The website is designed to easily allow friends and family to keep up to date by sharing information with everyone in one place. 

#### User Stories
* __Client/Couples Goals__
    * With a demographic of between the ages of 20-80 we want all information displayed in a user friendly, simple, informative layout. 
    * We want the website to be maintainable, in order to provide any neccessary updates. 

* __First time user Goals__
    * I want to easily know what the website is about, and why I should pay any interest to it. 
    * I want to be able to navigate through the website un-obstructed. 
    *
* __Returning user Goals__  
    * I want to have a section which will navigate to an external link in order to book accommodation.
    * I want a section which will allow me to RSVP. 
    * I want a section which allows me to choose menu items for the day of the wedding. 
    * I want to be able to contact the couple with any questions I may have. 

### Scope
* __Content Requirements__
    * The colours have to be consistent and match the colour theme for the wedding (Navy / Blush). 
    * All foreground information must be clear and presentable and not distracted by any background effects. 
    * The home page must set an overarching theme and feel for the website. 
    * Written content should be clear and concise. Long blocks of text should be avoided.
